  "description": "An ultra-soft black tee featuring a dramatic courtroom scene where a puzzled cat sits on the defendant stand. Underneath, in retro terminal green, it reads: 'git blame -c \"Mr. Fluffypaws\"'. The jury is made up of rubber ducks, and there's a pull-request gavel labeled 'merge conflict' hovering overhead.",
